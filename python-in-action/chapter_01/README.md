# Chapter 1: Introduction to Python Programming

## **How the Calculator Works:**

1. **User Input:**
   - The program asks the user to enter two numbers (`num1` and `num2`).
   - The program then prompts the user to select an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
2. **Conditionals:**
   - Based on the operation chosen by the user, the program performs the corresponding calculation using conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`).
   - If the user enters an invalid operation (anything other than `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`), it returns `"Invalid operation"`.
3. **Division by Zero:**
   - If the user tries to divide by zero, the program detects this and returns an error message (`"Error! Division by zero is not allowed."`).
4. **Output:**
   - The result of the calculation is printed.

## **Example Usage:**

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): +
The result is: 15.0
```

This project gives beginners a solid understanding of basic Python concepts like **user input**, **conditional statements**, and **handling errors** (in the case of division by zero).
