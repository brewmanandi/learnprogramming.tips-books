# Student Grade Tracker

## Overview

The **Student Grade Tracker** is a simple Python program that allows you to manage a collection of students and their corresponding grades. The program provides a menu-based interface where users can:

1. 📝 Add a student and their grade.
2. 👀 View all students and their grades.
3. ❌ Remove a student by their name.
4. 🚪 Exit the program.

This project demonstrates the use of Python dictionaries to store key-value pairs, where student names are the keys and their grades are the values.

## Features

- **Add a student and grade**: Enter a student's name and their grade to store it in the grade tracker.
- **View all students and grades**: Display all students in the system along with their grades.
- **Remove a student**: Delete a student from the tracker by providing their name.
- **Exit the program**: Exit the grade tracker with a witty farewell message.

## How to Run the Program

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.x is recommended).
2. Download the `student_grade_tracker.py` file from this repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the `student_grade_tracker.py` file is saved.
5. Run the program using the following command:
