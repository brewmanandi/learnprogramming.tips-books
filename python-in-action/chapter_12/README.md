# Weather App (Tkinter)

## Overview

The **Weather App** is a Python GUI application built with **Tkinter** that allows users to input a city name and displays the weather data for that city. This project uses placeholder weather data (Sunny, 25°C), but you can extend it to fetch real data from a weather API like OpenWeatherMap.

## Features

- **City Input**: Users can input the name of a city.
- **Weather Display**: Displays placeholder weather data when the user clicks "Show Weather".
- **GUI Elements**: Includes entry fields, labels, and buttons, organized using Tkinter's layout management.

## How to Run the Program

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` (comes pre-installed with Python)

### Steps:
1. Download the `weather_app_tkinter.py` file from this repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `weather_app_tkinter.py` is saved.
3. Run the program using the following command:

    ```bash
    python weather_app_tkinter.py
    ```

4. Enter a city name and click the "Show Weather" button to display the weather information.

## Example Interaction

```text
Enter city name: New York
Weather in New York: Sunny, 25°C
```

## Advanced Option

For advanced users, modify the code to fetch real-time weather data from an API like **OpenWeatherMap**. Use the `requests` library to make API requests and display live weather data.
