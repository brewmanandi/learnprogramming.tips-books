### **Breakdown of the Code:**

1. **Main Menu (`show_menu`):**
   - The main menu uses friendly, engaging language like `"📝 Add a task"` and `"❌ Remove a task"` to keep things fun while guiding the user through their options.
2. **Add Task (`add_task`):**
   - The function prompts the user for a new task, then adds it to the list with an encouraging message like `"Keep crushing it! 💪"` to boost their motivation.
3. **View Tasks (`view_tasks`):**
   - If the list is empty, it cheers the user on with a `"You're all caught up!"` message. Otherwise, it lists the tasks with a reminder to `"Keep up the good work! 🚀"`
4. **Remove Task (`remove_task`):**
   - The user is asked which task they want to remove, and the program humorously responds with `"One less thing to worry about! 🎯"` when the task is removed.
5. **Main Loop (`to_do_list_manager`):**
   - This loop drives the entire program, repeatedly showing the menu and handling user input. The witty exit message `"Go crush those tasks like the productivity ninja you are! 🥷"` keeps the tone light-hearted.
